# Project Name: Homework 10 Employee Management System

### Description of the Project: 

The Employee Tracker is a Node JS file to be used by a non-developer to view and interact with information stored in databases. The file is designed to manage a company’s employees using node inquirer and MySQL.

### Installation instructions: 

Install the Employee Tracker index.js file into your project folder along with the associated package.json file. Next, generate an unlocked package.json file by typing npm init -y in the project folder command line prompt. Then load the Inquirer, MySQL and Console.Table dependencies into your project folder by typing npm install Inquirer mysql console.table  –save in the command line prompt. You are now ready to use the Employee Tracker.

### Usage instructions: 

To use the Employee Tracker, open the index.js file within a program for writing code, such as VS Code, navigate to the project folder and type in ‘node index.js’ in the command prompt. A multiple choice question will appear asking if you would like to View All of Employees, View All Employees by Department, View All Employees by Role, Add Employee, Add Employee by Department, Add Employee Role and Update Employee. Scroll up and down with the arrow keys and then select one with the Enter key. The Tracker will generate a table based on your selection.
